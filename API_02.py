# Pandas is an API

# Pandas is actually set of software components , much of which is not 
# even written in Python.

# You create a dictionary, this is just data.
dict_={'a':[11,21,31],'b':[12,22,32]}

# When you create a Pandas object with the Dataframe constructor in 
# API lingo, this is an "instance". The data in the dictionary is passed 
# along to the pandas API. You then use the dataframe to communicate with 
# the API.
df=pd.DataFrame(dict_)
type(df)

# When you call the method head the dataframe communicates with the API 
# displaying the first few rows of the dataframe.
df.head()

# When you call the method mean,the API will calculate the mean and return 
# the value.
df.mean()

# REST APIs
# Rest APIâ€™s function by sending a request, the request is communicated via 
# HTTP message. The HTTP message usually contains a JSON file. This 
# contains instructions for what operation we would like the service or 
# resource to perform. In a similar manner, API returns a response, via an 
# HTTP message, this response is usually contained within a JSON. 
# In cryptocurrency a popular method to display the movements of the price
# of a currency.

# In this lab, we will be using the CoinGecko API to create one of these 
# candlestick graphs for Bitcoin. We will use the API to get the price data 
# for 30 days with 24 observation per day, 1 per hour. We will find the 
# max, min, open, and close price per day meaning we will have 30 
# candlesticks and use that to generate the candlestick graph. Although 
# we are using the CoinGecko API we will use a Python client/wrapper for 
# the API called PyCoinGecko. PyCoinGecko will make performing the requests 
# easy and it will deal with the enpoint targeting. Lets start off by 
# getting the data we need. Using the 
# get_coin_market_chart_by_id(id, vs_currency, days). id is the name of the 
# coin you want, vs_currency is the currency you want the price in, and 
# days is how many days back from today you want.
cg = CoinGeckoAPI()

bitcoin_data = cg.get_coin_market_chart_by_id(id='bitcoin', vs_currency='usd', days=30)

print(type(bitcoin_data ))

# The response we get is in the form of a JSON which includes the price, 
# market caps, and total volumes along with timestamps for each 
# observation. We are focused on the prices so we will select that data.
bitcoin_price_data = bitcoin_data['prices']

bitcoin_price_data[0:5]

# Finally lets turn this data into a Pandas DataFrame.
data = pd.DataFrame(bitcoin_price_data, columns=['TimeStamp', 'Price'])

# Now that we have the DataFrame we will convert the timestamp to datetime 
# and save it as a column called Date. We will map our unix_to_datetime to 
# each timestamp and convert it to a readable datetime.
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['TimeStamp'], unit='ms')

# Using this modified dataset we can now group by the Date and find the min, 
# max, open, and close for the candlesticks.
candlestick_data = data.groupby(data.Date.dt.date, as_index=False).agg({"Price": ['min', 'max', 'first', 'last']})

# Finally we are now ready to use plotly to create our Candlestick Chart.
