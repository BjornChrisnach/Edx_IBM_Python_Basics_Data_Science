# If we would like to generate an object that contains elements ordered from 0 to 2 we simply
# use the following command:

# Use the range
# range(3)

# The for loop enables you to execute a code block multiple times. For example, you would use this
# if you would like to print out every element in a list. Let's try to use a for loop to print all
# the years presented in the list dates:
# For loop example

dates = [1982, 1980, 1973]
N = len(dates)

for i in range(N):
    print(dates[i])

# In this example we can print out a sequence of numbers from 0 to 7:
# Example of for loop
for i in range(0, 8):
    print(i)

# Exmaple of for loop, loop through list
for year in dates:
    print(year)

# Use for loop to change the elements in list
squares = ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'purple', 'blue']

for i in range(0, 5):
    print("Before square ", i, 'is',  squares[i])
    squares[i] = 'white'
    print("After square ", i, 'is',  squares[i])

# We can access the index and the elements of a list as follows:
# Loop through the list and iterate on both index and element value

squares = ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'purple', 'blue']

for i, square in enumerate(squares):
    print(i, square)

# Letâ€™s say we would like to iterate through list dates and stop at the year 1973, then print out
# the number of iterations. This can be done with the following block of code:
# While Loop Example
dates = [1982, 1980, 1973, 2000]

i = 0
year = dates[0]

while(year != 1973):
    print(year)
    i = i + 1
    year = dates[i]


print("It took ", i, "repetitions to get out of loop.")

# Write a while loop to display the values of the Rating of an album playlist stored in the list
